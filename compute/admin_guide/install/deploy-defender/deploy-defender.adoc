== Deploy Prisma Cloud Defenders

To take advantage of the agent-based security features of Prisma Cloud, you must deploy the Defender agent.
Prisma Cloud offers you the following Defender types to protect specific types of assets and to ensure optimal deployment into the environment.
Defenders enforce the policies you set in the Prisma Cloud console and, generally, you should deploy Defenders whenever you can.

There are four xref:./defender-types.adoc[Defender types] based on the assets they protect.

* Container Defenders
* Host Defenders
* Serverless Defenders
* App-embedded Defenders

Based on how the Defenders are deployed, there ar two types of Defenders.

* Single Defenders: Deploy a single Defender to a single container, a bare-metal or virtual host, a serverless function, or as part of your workload.
* Orchestrator Defenders: Deploy Defenders on an entire cluster at the orchestration level.

To avoid manually deploying Defenders on each container, VM, or host, you can use auto-Defend to deploy Defenders automatically on AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Deploy a single Defender to protect these assets.

* Linux Container 
* Windows Container
* App-Embedded
* Linux Host or VM
* Windows Host or VM
* AWS Serverless Functions
* Azure Serverless Functions

Deploy an orchestrator Defender to protect assets in these orchestrators. 

* ECS
* Kubernetes
* Openshift
* Tanzu Application Service

=== Deployment Scenarios

Install the Defender type that best secures the resource you want to protect.
Install Defender on each host that you want Prisma Cloud to protect.
Container Defenders protect both the containers and the underlying host.
Host Defenders are designed for legacy hosts that have no capability for running containers.
Host Defenders protect the host only.
For serverless technologies, embed Defender directly in the resource.

The scenarios here show examples of how the various Defender types can be deployed.

[.section]
==== Scenario #1

Stand-alone Container Defenders are installed on hosts that are not part of a cluster.
Stand-alone Container Defenders might be required in any number of situations.

For example, a very simple evaluation setup might consist of two virtual machines.

* *1* -- One VM runs Onebox (Console + Container Defender).
* *2* -- To protect the container workload on a second VM, install another stand-alone Container Defender.

[.section]
==== Scenario #2

For clusters, such as Kubernetes and OpenShift, Prisma Cloud utilizes orchestrator-native constructs, such as DaemonSets, to guarantee that Defender runs on every node in the cluster.
For example, the following setup has three different types of Defender deployments.

* *1* -- In the cluster, Container Defenders are deployed as a DaemonSet.
(Assume this is a Kubernetes cluster; it would be a similar construct, but with a different name, for AWS ECS etc).
* *2* -- On the host dedicated to scanning registry images, which runs outside the cluster, a stand-alone Container Defender is deployed.
* *3* -- On the legacy database server, which doesn't run containers at all, a Host Defender is deployed.
Host Defenders are a type of stand-alone Defender that run on hosts that don't have Docker installed.

[.section]
==== Scenario #3

Managed services that run functions and containers on-demand isolate the runtime from the underlying infrastructure.
In these types of environments, Defender cannot access the host's operating system with elevated privileges to observe activity and enforce policies in the runtime.
Instead, Defender must be built into the runtime, and control application execution and detect and prevent real-time attacks from within.
App Embedded Defender can be deployed to protect any container, regardless of the platform or runtime, whether it's Docker, runC, or Diego on Tanzu Application Service.

* *1* -- Serverless Defender is embedded into each AWS Lambda function.
